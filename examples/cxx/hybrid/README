This directory contains a number of examples that show how to
use the Embedded C++/Hybrid mapping. The following list gives
an overview of each example. See the README files in example
directories for more information on each example.

hello
  A simple "Hello, world!" example that shows how to parse XML
  documents.

library
  Shows how to handle more complex data structures, modify the
  object model, and serialize the modified object model back to
  XML.
  
minimal
  Shows how to perform parsing and serialization as well as use the
  object model when the mapping is configured without support for
  STL, iostream, or C++ exceptions.

multiroot
  Shows how to parse XML vocabularies with multiple root elements.

wildcard
  Shows how to parse, store in the object model, and serialize XML
  data matched by XML Schema wildcards (any and anyAttribute).

filter
  Shows how to filter the XML data during parsing and object model
  during serialization.

streaming
  Shows how to perform partially event-driven, partially in-memory
  XML processing.

compositors
  Shows how to create, access, and modify object models with complex
  nested choice and sequence compositors.
