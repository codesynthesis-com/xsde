# xsde-examples - XSD/e examples

This package contains examples for `xsde`, the XML Schema to C++ data binding
compiler for mobile and embedded systems.

The Embedded C++/Parser, C++/Serializer, and C++/Hybrid mapping examples can
be found in the `cxx/parser/`, `cxx/serializer/`, and `cxx/hybrid/`
subdirectories, respectively. For the summary of available examples for each
mapping, see `cxx/parser/README`, `cxx/serializer/README`, and
`cxx/hybrid/README`, respectively. Each example also comes with its own
`README` file that provides a detailed description of the functionality shown
as well as the steps to build and run it.
